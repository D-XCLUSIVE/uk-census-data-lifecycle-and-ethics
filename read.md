UK Census Dataset – Source and Governance

Dataset Overview
This project is based on data from the UK Census, a national population survey conducted every ten years. The census collects information on population size, demographics, housing, ethnicity, education, and employment, and is used extensively for public policy, academic research, and decision-support systems.

This portfolio focuses primarily on Census 2021 data for England and Wales.

Data Ownership and Stewardship
Data Owner: Office for National Statistics (ONS)
Primary Steward: Office for National Statistics (ONS)
Access Provider: UK Data Service

The ONS is responsible for the collection, processing, anonymisation, and publication of census data. The UK Data Service provides long-term access, preservation, and metadata documentation for secondary research use.

Data Collection Context
Census 2021 data were collected using a combination of:
- Digital-first online questionnaires
- Paper questionnaires (on request)
- Field staff follow-up for non-response areas

These methods were supported by privacy statements and legal protections under UK data protection and census legislation, as discussed in the main portfolio document.

Data Provenance and Documentation
Provenance information for the census data is provided through:
- Official ONS methodological reports
- Metadata and documentation hosted by the UK Data Service
- Published quality and methodology information (QMI)

However, as noted in the portfolio analysis, some stages of data transformation (such as optical character recognition of paper questionnaires) are not fully transparent, representing a limitation in complete provenance traceability.

Data Quality and Ethical Considerations
UK Census data is subject to known quality challenges, including:
- Non-response and coverage errors
- Undercounting of hard-to-reach populations
- Measurement and processing biases
- Classification changes between census years

These issues are critically analysed in the portfolio in relation to bias, fairness, and the reliability of intelligent systems that rely on census data.

Data Access and Licensing
Due to licensing, privacy, and ethical constraints, raw census datasets are not redistributed in this repository. Researchers wishing to access the data should do so directly through the UK Data Service under the appropriate access conditions and training requirements.
